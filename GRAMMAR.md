* Al = She
* Alh = He
* Zan = It

Everything is "it" unless it's got 2 variants. Like a cow and a bull, a cow is Mu while a bull is Muh. Alh (male/opposite) words end with "h".

* Mi = I
* Di = You
* Al = She
* Alh = He
* Zan = It
* Mis = Us
* Dis = You
* Als/Alhs/Zans = They or Those
* Female applies when genders mixed.

Adjectives are either male or (pseudo) female, opposite, for example:

* Su = Wet
* Suh = Dry

Verbs are universal. Future is defined by "vi" (will), and past by "vas" (was) before the verb.

* I will speak = Mi vi zek
* I speak = Mi zek
* I spoke = Mi vas zek

Plural (for everything) is just the word with -s suffix.

* "Not" is "eh".
* "And" is "es".

If two letters are joined, like in Komahc; Kom + Mahc, they become a single letter.

C is used when a word ends with an H, but isn't an opposite of anything. The "C" sound is very subtle.
